The Fictional Workflow Builder has a few global dependencies:  NodeJS and TypeScript.  Both must be installed on the development machine before running the code.

After the dependencies are installed, we must first clone the repository.  We can do this by executing the following command in a terminal window:
# git clone https://github.com/EhrenEschmann/fictional-workflow-builder.git	

From there we must use the NodeJS Package Manager (npm) to install local dependencies for the Fictional Workflow Builder.
	# npm install
    
Finally, we can run a script to build the application, run our test web server, and open it in a browser with npm:
	# npm start
